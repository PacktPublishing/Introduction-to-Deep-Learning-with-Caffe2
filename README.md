## About the Video Course
Deep learning is one of the most highly sought-after skills in the technology sector. If you want to take a crack at AI, then this course will help you do so. One of the many reasons for choosing Caffe2 for this course is its processing speed as compared to other platforms. Since the basis of the architecture in Caffe2 is CUDA, it provides flexibility in optimizing the code as per the hardware being used.

You’ll learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks and develop an understanding of convolutional networks, RNNs, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm and more. You’ll be working on various projects throughout this MOOC with a focus on how to train and manipulate a deep neural network effectively. You’ll practice all these ideas in Caffe2 using Python programming languages.

By the end of the course, you’ll gain an understanding of every element of Caffe2 and be able to use the library in the most efficient way.
